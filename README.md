 haallloo :) we're the flipside, an introject-heavy system. we're currently back in our ponytown grind, if you see us come say hi! we don't bite...
</p>

<p align="center">
 some of us have our own skins, but if not you can check this github account's status for who's currently fronting if you're curious - those without their own skins may use our collective one instead: it's blue n white n has a very distinguishing name ;p

 9/10 times we're sitting with our trio, consisting of our lovely psys (@flairforthedramatic) and our wonderful buddy (@milkywaysys). we adore both of them so much... wow wow... hi guys...
</p>

<p align="center">
 our host has his own account (@cwtskies) and some little freak that likes being special does too (@dsaf3), you may see them around with those github accounts linked instead of this one :)
